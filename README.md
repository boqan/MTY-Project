This is my NodeJS project for Mentor The Young, which i'm doing in collaboration with my mentor Martin Marinov.

## Project idea: 
#### We have some partners records in a text file (partners.txt) -
#### one partner per line, JSON lines formatted. We want to invite
#### any partner within 100km of our Sofia office for our
#### companyâ€™s birthday celebration. This is a program that will
#### read the full list of partners and output the names and
#### partners ids of matching partners (within 100 km.), sorted by
#### Partner ID (ascending).
